Changelog

1.8.1
=====

- Added message_size_limit configuration flag to modify the EHLO 205-SIZE
  output. Some clients read this value and evaluate the message they're
  sending to the server and refuse to send it due to the message size being
  larger than the default limit.
  This limit is not enforced by the server itself.
